# Rakuten tag for Google Tag Manager Server Side

Rakuten s2s tag stores the siteID, ranMID, ranEAID, and ranSiteID URL parameters inside the rakuten_ cookies on a page view event. On a conversion event, it sends event data together with coookies to Rakuten.

- `Stape Container API Key` - find it insiede your sGTM container on stape. Rakuten authentification can't be created using sGTM only. That's why, for now, Rakuten requires a stape account.
- `Affiliate Merchant ID (MID) and Affiliate Key` - You can find it in your Rakuten account or by contacting your Rakentan account manager.
- `Order ID` - a unique transaction number.
- `Currency` - The ISO4217 currency code reference.
